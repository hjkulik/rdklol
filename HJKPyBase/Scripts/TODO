TODO:
1) Check for charge and remove
2) Check for missed counterions and remove
3) Figure out what to do if some structures have bad geometry and others don't - maybe generate all five geoms first and only run calc if all 5 geoms can get generated w/o any forcing?
4) Cleaner/better setup.pkl/etc logging/structure.


log: generated successfully? set up to queue (and job nums, directory, did it finish?)
logging:
write the reg #, the smiles(?), the jobids, poll the output when a job finishes/and or if the job gets killed is there a trigger/way to capture that outcome?
-Log should have job id when the job is submitted, 
-Log should have outcome of job - did it finish, did scf not converge, did it crash, did it run out of time? Maybe that's a separate logfile, or even one pickle per ligand directory?

want to change to 2gpus if the job is big enough? #atoms not big enough now.


TODO!!! Get a logging system set up
DONE: (but could be cleaner): Get adam's stuff working with mine
DONE: Get a sanity check on structures before they run -warns for anomalous distances
TBD: Recording alignment results, not just to screen

Adam stuff:
 --dbquery picklefile.pkl --dbnum $num;
that should be the pkl file in ~/Instruct/Py/Pickles
number is optional and specifies which line of dictionary to use.

Otherwise should use one, write to log, check if written to log.
should also have option to override and specify reg #.


Other: Calculate just optimized/unoptimized ligand energy to get estimate of total ligand binding energy? Only relevant for cases where the ligands might not want to bind...maybe that's never.

Todo: Find cases where adam's thing failed. - one with kekulizing for saving to file, one with idx being referenced before it was defined(?) maybe atoms messedup/missing.
